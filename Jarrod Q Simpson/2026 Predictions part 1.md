Here's 3 dumb WWE predictions for 2026 early

  

1. Tessa Blancard will be in the 2026 Royal Rumble

  

Since I don't watch a whole lot of TNA Wrestling, I have no idea what's going on there. I just know as Jordyne Grace was making her exit, Tessa returned. What's worthing pointing out ofr context of these predictions is she made a break from pro-wrestling durin gthe pandemic after some controversy followed her as multiple peers recanted her being very rude and racist to other professionals, all of which she has seem to ge some credit for apologizing for, while maintainger her innocence of the racist part. Nowadays, some wrestling companies, and the big universe, seem to be forgiving of some individuals that stand accused, but unconvicted even in the court of public opinion due to lack of evidence if they are liked, which Tessa as a peak in-ring performer with a legendary namesake, is pretty likeable by those standards. However she is credited for not being such a nice person in locker rooms. The thing about WWE is they always seem to replicate a lot of what the world has to offer inside of their "universe" so for everything that Tessa is on theoutside, WWE has one of those. Enter Charlotte Flair.

  

Namesake, check

Top tier in-ring performer, check

Tumotious and public love life, check

Perceibly lacking in the locker room friendships, check

  

Naturally, Charlotte Flair coming out of NXT developement many moons ago did have 3 associates that she came up with and bewteen the baskstage and the IWC, they we christened The 4 Horse Women, a play on the notoriously known 4 Horsemen faction that included both Charlotte's and Tessa's fathers. It was easy for us to believe that they were all friends behind the scenes, but that also turned out to be kayfabe. As a Sasha turned Mercedes Mone left the company, a very public falling out with The Man Becky Lynch, and even Bailey in a recent interview admitting that she really doesn't have a personal relationship with her, Charlotte is left alone on a Smackdown roster at the displeasure of fans not excited anout the star's return fro injury to win the Royal Rumble, punching her ticket to a lack luster and cringe worty build to a middle card title match at Wrestlemania and in a current storyline with fan favorite Alexa Bliss centered around her lack of friendships in the locker room all while sharing working quarters with real life ex-husband #3, Andrade El Edilo. Even with all of this, the WWE should still be lookng to get their money's worth of the 14 time world champion with some interesting storyline that make fans care. Especially in a landscape that is becomming very exciting with women supertars of WWE competitors in expaths Mercedes Mone, Timeless Toni Storm, and Athena to name a few. It's not uncommon for WWE to pull some strings for top star and their storylines and the precendent that they have set for most NXT shows and some of their PLEs. Enter The Royal Rumble

  

Royal Rumbles in general have been a place for outside surprises in in the form of celebrity entrants since inception, but for the past several years, the WWE seems to have incuded the TNA Women's World Champion from Mickie James, to Naomi, and Jordyne Grace twice.It's safe to say taht this will be a regular thing going forward as WWE and TNA seem to have a pretty open working relationship at this point. We've yet to ge a men's entrant into the mens rumble, but the women's world champion is pretty much a guaranteed. Now as I write this, TNA Slammerversary is 24 hours away and current TNA champ Masha Slammovich is defending her title against NXT women's champ Jacy Jayne. Anyone thinking eith one of them is making a Rumble debut in 2026, I'll pause for clarity...

  

So I predict Tessa wins the TNA Women's World Championship, enters the Royal Rumble, and teases the crowd that she's in cahoots with Charlotte to make it seem she's going to win again and getting massive heat on her in the match. Not sure if it goes anywhere else that year, but they will use the moemnet to see how the crowd reacts in hopes of givinh Charlotte something significant to do.
